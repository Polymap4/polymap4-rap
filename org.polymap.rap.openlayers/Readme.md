# Polymap Openlayers Widget

This plugin adds a openlayers 2 based map widget to the eclipse RAP framework.

## Sample Usage

See /org.polymap.rap.openlayers/src/org/polymap/rap/openlayers/demo/DemoEntryPoint.java

You can also start the launch config *Openlayers Sample* and point your browser to http://localhost:10080/ol

## Todos

* openlayers 3
* resources should be load locally
* all controls, layers and types must be fixed
* we need some tests
* the demo app should be moved into a separate project
* maven/tycho based builds would be cool
